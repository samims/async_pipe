# Concurrency Demo

A practical demonstration of Python concurrency patterns.

## Goals

- Implement appropriate use of async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Implement multiprocessing for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement and use threading for blocking I/O operations
- Implement a realistic data processing pipeline

## TODO

- [ ] Implement async data fetcher
- [ ] Add multiprocessing for CPU work
- [ ] Implement threading for file I/O
- [ ] Create orchestration layer
- [ ] Add tests and documentation
